===== Verification of Prior Knowledge ===== 

The verification for expected prior knowledge is done via an mandatory entrytest. You can register to the entrytest via the RESET-Tool.
Only after the positive passing of the entrytest you are eligible to participate in the groupphase.
By participating in the entrytest you will receive a certificate.

===== Scope of the Entrytest ===== 

During the entrytest you have to solve a small algorithmic task and communicate with a given REST-api.
You have to use the Lab-Infrastructure (Python3, Java 1.8+, php_cli and nodejs are installed in the Lab!)
Documentation and access to the api will be granted during the test.

===== Sample Entrytest ===== 

We'll provided a sample entrytest for you. The workflow of communicating with the solution checker will be the same in the real entrytest.
You are allowed to upload your communication code samples here and use it during your entrytest.

The Sample Entrytest will be available on Saturday 08.10.

The uploaded files have to be your own work!

You can start the ASE-Entrytest.jar via commandline:

java -jar ./ASE-Entrytest-WS16.jar
